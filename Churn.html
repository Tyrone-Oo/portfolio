									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>
In today‚Äôs competitive telecom market, customer churn‚Äîwhen users discontinue their service‚Äîremains a critical concern. With an industry churn rate ranging from 15% to 25%, retaining customers is not just a priority; it's a strategic necessity. Since acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones, businesses need to proactively identify which customers are most at risk of leaving.

This project focuses on using data-driven insights to understand why customers churn and how businesses can anticipate and reduce attrition. By analyzing a range of customer behaviors‚Äîsuch as service usage, demographics, and engagement channels‚Äîwe aim to uncover patterns that drive churn and help inform targeted retention strategies..</p>

								<hr/>	<h2>üîç Key Analytical Questions</h2>
									<li>What proportion of customers have churned vs. those who remain active?</li>

									<li>Are there any churn trends by gender, age, or tenure?</li>

									<li>Which services or contract types are most associated with churned customers?</li>

									<li>What are the most profitable services, and how do they relate to churn?</li>

									<li>Which customer features or behaviors most strongly predict churn?</li>

These insights will help guide personalized retention efforts, improve resource allocation, and enhance long-term customer loyalty strategies.</p>

<h3>  PowerBI Desktop visualization </h3>
<p> PowerBI is really powerful tool to viasulized fidings effectively and efficiently.
I imported my excel data set into PowerBi Desktop, validate, clean and modify data sets and columns to
create meaniful data viasulizations. In order to see insight relatinships between customer churn and different products
, i had to create new columns by unpivoting methods and transformed them into rows from 8 different propducts they were
originally in individual columns. <br/>

	<li> 	Obviously, fiber optic internet services has the highest churn rate with 41.89%.</li>
	<li>	When we look at Churn by Tenure, we can see that first few months are critical periods and if we can keep customers first few months, they become royal 
		customers.</li>
	<li>	Price levels have been transformed into managable groups as Basi, Silver, Gold and Dimond. According to bar graph, we can
		assumed that the price range fall into 50 and 100 ( Gold level) didn't match value and customer expectations. </li>
	<li>	In term of contract type, obviously, month to month (rolling) contract has highest chance to leave the company. </li> 
	<li>	On the far right, I created slicer to have better understanding on relationship between Tenure and Cburn and other categories. That 
	will help stakeholders concentrate insights of cusotmers behaviour year by year. </li> </br>
